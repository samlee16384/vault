They were finally sitting at the table, acting all coy and respectful. Their lawyers were present and ready to negotiate the terms of their divorce, so they had to be mature. But her ex-husband knew that he wasn’t going to play like that today. So he let her read her terms and get hopeful before he could deny everything she asked for. The blonde bombshell was so mad when he asked for the dog. She was furious, so much that she asked for the lawyers to leave them alone. He stood up so confidently. She forgot how he used to affect her body with just one look. When they locked eyes, she could feel her juices dripping from her pussy. She was in big trouble now, but in full honesty, she never really cared. Her soon-to-be ex-husband was the best fuck of her life, and she was aching to get one last pounding from him before they say goodbye and walk away. It was never about love, they were just better off as fuck buddies, and both of them knew that. So he traced his fingers down her arms, and he reached down to kiss her. She let him slip his tongue in her mouth, and she was lost. Her pussy was now controlling her whole body, and she soon found herself on her knees with a rock-hard dick in her mouth. But she had no time to think. She sucked him hard and made his dick super wet. He got her naked and on the table and pushed his hard dick inside of her. He was fucking her at a wonderful pace. Up and down his ex-wife fucked his cock, riding him like a jockey rode a racehorse. She was such a little slut for him. He pounded her hard, and he loved to hear her beg and moan at the same time. She made him an offer he couldn’t refuse: he squirted cum all over her face and then the motherfucker signed the papers.
